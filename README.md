# Sales Forecasting Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to forecast sales for various items across multiple outlets using historical data. By analyzing patterns in the data, including item details and outlet characteristics, the model predicts the future sales of items based on past trends.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is loaded from a CSV file (`Train.csv`) and contains the following columns:
- **Item_Identifier**: Unique ID for each item.
- **Item_Weight**: Weight of the item.
- **Item_Fat_Content**: Indicates whether the item is low fat or regular.
- **Item_Visibility**: Percentage visibility of the item across outlets.
- **Item_Type**: Category to which the item belongs (e.g., Dairy, Snack Foods).
- **Item_MRP**: Maximum retail price of the item.
- **Outlet_Identifier**: Unique ID for each outlet.
- **Outlet_Establishment_Year**: The year when the outlet was established.
- **Outlet_Size**: Size of the outlet (e.g., Small, Medium, Large).
- **Outlet_Location_Type**: Type of city in which the outlet is located.
- **Outlet_Type**: Type of the outlet (e.g., Supermarket, Grocery Store).
- **Item_Outlet_Sales**: Target variable, which represents the total sales of the product in a particular outlet.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning**:
    - Loaded and explored the dataset for missing values and inconsistencies.
    - Conducted descriptive statistics to understand the distribution of features.
    
2. **Data Visualization**:
    - Plotted the distribution of key features like `Item_MRP`, `Outlet_Size`, and `Item_Outlet_Sales`.
    - Visualized correlations between variables.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
    - Handled missing values in `Item_Weight` and `Outlet_Size`.
    - Created new features based on existing ones, such as `Item_Visibility_bins` and `Outlet_Age`.

4. **Modeling**:
    - Implemented machine learning models to predict sales, such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
    - Evaluated model performance using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Square Error).

## Requirements

The following libraries are required to run the project:

```bash
pandas==1.x.x
numpy==1.x.x
matplotlib==3.x.x
seaborn==0.x.x
scikit-learn==0.x.x
```

To install the required packages, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sales-forecasting-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd sales-forecasting-project
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook to train the model and generate predictions:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Sales_Forecasting_Project.ipynb
   ```

## Results

The model achieved a reasonable accuracy in predicting the sales for items across various outlets. Future improvements could include trying advanced algorithms such as XGBoost or experimenting with hyperparameter tuning for better performance.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how historical sales data, combined with outlet and product information, can be used to forecast future sales. The model can potentially help businesses optimize inventory and improve sales strategies.
